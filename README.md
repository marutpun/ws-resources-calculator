## How It Works

In Whiteout Survival, the main resources are Meat, Wood, Iron, and Coal, each of which can be gathered or earned as rewards. However, each resource has a different collection rate:

- **Meat**: Ratio of 1.0
- **Wood**: Ratio of 1.0
- **Coal**: Ratio of 0.2
- **Iron**: Ratio of 0.05

To match the quantity of Meat (or Wood) with Coal, you need to collect **20 times** as much Coal (1.0 / 0.05 = 20). Similarly, to have an amount of Iron equal to Meat or Wood, you must gather **5 times** the amount of Iron (1.0 / 0.2 = 5).

This means:

To equal Meat (or Wood), collect:
- **Coal**: 20 times
- **Iron**: 5 times

Use this calculator to help plan your resource gathering effectively!
